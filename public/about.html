<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Mariama Nyakateh Nyodeka. I am based in the United Kingdom.
  I am a very creative individual with a passion for learning about new technologies.
  I have a background in Healthcare Market Research but recently gained knowledge of ServiceNow and Tableau. 
  
<p>Exploring the area of Data Analysis and Software Development (both of which require coding skills) led me to successfully completed a Coding challenge.
  My need to gain more understanding of coding and my interest in Junior Developer roles resulted in me taking up a short online Web Development course.  
</p>

<p>I am thoroughly enjoying developing my skills so far, and as such, I am now eager to pursue a Junior Developer role.
  I am open to both temporary and permanent employment opportunities. Should you want to discuss suitable opportunities, do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you!
