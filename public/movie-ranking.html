<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>A classic movie! Loved it when it came out, watched it several times and cried every time. It's just a great movie!</p>
<h3>Supergirl</h3>
<p>My favourite childhood movie. I never got tired of watching this or Superman during my childhood years.</p>
<h3>Cinderella</h3>
<p>One of my favourite disney movies. Just loved the way her Fairy Godmother helped her out to go to the ball. No hate could stop her destiny. Really loved the happy ending!</p>
